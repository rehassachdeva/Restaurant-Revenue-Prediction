Project Deadlines are divided into three phases:

    Interim Evaluation I      31st August

    Interim Evaluation II     24th September

    Final Submission         26th October

    Presentation                04-06th November



In each phase it is required that a part of project plan/execution be completed which is as follows::

Interim Evaluation I  -- Project Definition and Project Plan

    Get a clear understanding of the project

    Read about standard tools and techniques

    Teams need to decide what they will be doing for the project (limit your scope -- don't try to do too much or too less)

    Try figuring out tools required for the project

    Teams need to share the scope of the project  and the parts of project they will implement on their own 


Interim Evaluation II -- Initial Implementation

    Try implementing the pipeline of the project (For eg : Feature Extraction , Learning Algorithms(Basic One/s), Performance Reporting)



Final Submission

    Implement two or more  Pattern Recognition techniques (other than what is taught in the course) ** -- This is not a hard requirement and may not apply to some projects which require work in other areas such as feature extraction  

    A research paper format pdf (Sample Pdf will be uploaded later)

    Poster Submission (Likely)

    Final Code submission

    Slides for presentation  

    To be submitted on the portal separately before deadline

    This is a hard deadline and work done afterwards will be rejected.


Project Presentation
